# Realistic Agility Mod | Realistic Armor Weight

> This mod was made to work alongside other mods that enables the player to increase it's moving speed. Like LevelZ for instance.

Mod functionality:

1. Weight will boost your damage output
2. Weight will also slow you down
3. Default speed will affect how high you jump (and you can jump slightly higher when running)
4. Higher speeds will also increase damage output
5. Elytras give you extra moving speed

Known behavior:
- It's fully functional on single player
- When installed server side only, it does nothing
- When installed on client side only, you only get the jump boost
- When installed on both client and server side it fully works BUT there is a slight delay when player wants to run (like 0.3 seconds, probably because of latency)

> If you have any idea of how to fix the input lag bug, I'll be thankful for your help
